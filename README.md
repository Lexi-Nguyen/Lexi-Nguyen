## Hi there 👋

I'm Lexi, an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong interest in turning data into meaningful insights. I enjoy working with data to uncover patterns, support decision-making, and tell clear stories through visuals.

🔭 I’m currently building interactive dashboards and reports using **Power BI**, focusing on clean design and usability.  
🌱 I’m learning more about data modelling, DAX, and analytical problem-solving.  
📊 I enjoy creating data visualisations that are easy to understand and useful for real-world business scenarios.  
👯 I’m open to collaborating on beginner-to-intermediate data analytics projects.  
💬 Ask me about Power BI dashboards, data visualisation, or analytics projects.  

Thanks for stopping by!
